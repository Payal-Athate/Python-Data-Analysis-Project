# Supply Chain Analysis (Using Python)

## Project Objectives
This project aims to analyze supply chain data to identify inefficiencies, optimize logistics, and improve overall performance. The key objectives include:
- Understanding supply chain bottlenecks.
- Analyzing key performance metrics such as lead time, order fulfillment, and inventory levels.
- Visualizing trends and patterns in supply chain operations.
- Providing actionable insights for supply chain optimization.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11 for data processing and analysis.
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.

## Process
- Data Collection:
    - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (supply_chain_data.csv).

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values and data cleaning.
  - Converting data types where necessary.
  - Checking for duplicated values

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Summary statistics of key metrics.
  - Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
  - Identifying trends in supply chain performance.

- Visualization & Insights:
  - Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.
  - Identifying outliers and inefficiencies.
  - Gaining insights into order processing times, supplier performance, and logistics bottlenecks.

## Key Insights & Conclusions
- Certain suppliers have significantly higher lead times, impacting delivery schedules.
- Order fulfillment rates vary across different regions, suggesting optimization opportunities.
- Inventory levels fluctuate inconsistently, indicating the need for better demand forecasting.
- ogistics inefficiencies were identified in specific transportation routes.
